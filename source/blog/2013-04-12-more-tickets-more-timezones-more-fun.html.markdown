Well, our first ticket batch sale went...pretty darn fast. But fear not, many more tickets are available for your dereliction and the next ticket sale is coming. Actually two more batches are coming next week!

We will be releasing tickets in two batches. Why two? Well, because we want to cater for different timezones! Our web traffic and sales analytics have shown that we have demand reaching from the US West coast down to Australia.

So here is how it is going to work. We will have a batch of tickets released on **Wednesday, April 17th at [05:00 UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=EuRuKo+2013+2nd+ticket+batch%21&iso=20130417T05)** targeting mostly Japan, Australia and US West Coast and another on **Friday, April 19th at [17:00 UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=EuRuKo+2013+3rd+ticket+batch%21&iso=20130419T17)** targeting again mostly Europe, Africa and US East Coast. Both batches will be available through [Eventora](https://www.eventora.com/en/Events/euruko-2013-athens). Hopefully this will cover the whole world :)

Once again the ticket price is **60 &euro;**. Remember, that you can also buy a [limited supporter ticket](/blog/2013-04-12-above-and-beyond/) at anytime for **250 &euro;**.

If you have any better ideas, please tell us so on Twitter or with a comment below.

Weâ€™re soooo excited and soooo doing our best to cater for everybody (or as much as possible)!
