The first time I attended Euruko was 2008. I managed to get a talk accepted so I didn't have to worry about a ticket.
Every year after that I fell victim to what I have recently seen called the "Euruko ticket fight".

The conference is popular and tickets sell out in record speeds. It's a pleasant problem for a conference organizer, but we are not professional conference organizers! We are part of the community and have ourselves been subjected to the same frustration of not being able to secure a ticket for the conference we love. So we will introduce a couple of different ways to distribute tickets. 

The first of these is something our Dutch friends established last year for Euruko 2012: Tickets reserved for Ruby user groups. 
Interesting fact: Almost half of this year's organizing committee got tickets for the Amsterdam conference this way.

For Euruko 2013 there will be 80 reserved tickets for Ruby user groups. If you are a member of a Ruby user group and would like tickets then please fill in the [form](https://docs.google.com/a/euruko2013.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFhXcDQtQlQ5SGZJTDNzaEZCZEx5R1E6MQ).

Give us the name of the user group along the number of tickets you would like and any information that will help us verify your claim .
We cannot guarantee that you will get all the tickets you ask for and if there are more requests than the 80 tickets we have reserved we will distrbute them evenly.

User groups are the heart of every local communitty and Euruko is the best venue for the local communities to connect, communicate and cooperate. Join us in making Euruko 2013 one of the best Ruby conferences!
