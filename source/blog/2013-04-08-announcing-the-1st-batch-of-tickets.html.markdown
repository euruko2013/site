Hi Rubyists!

After so many months of preparation, finally the wait is over! So mark the date: tickets go on sale on **Friday 12th of April, [14:00 UTC](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=EuRuKo+2013+1st+ticket+batch%21&iso=20130412T14)** through [Eventora](https://www.eventora.com/en/Events/euruko-2013-athens).

![Soon](/images/blog/soon.jpg "Soon...")

### How much?

The ticket price is going to be **60 &euro;**. As you may know, EuRuKo has traditionally been a conference with a very reasonable ticket price. The reason is simple: it's an event organized by the community for the community.

Of course, this wouldn't have been possible without the love of our [sponsors](/#sponsors)!

### How many tickets?

The tickets will be released in batches and the first batch is going to be **<strike>100</strike> 150 tickets**. More will follow of course :-)

### So what do I get with a ticket?

Firstly you get to come to a conference where [you can decide who is going to speak](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals)! In case you haven’t noticed our call for proposals has opened and we already have many awesome presentations. On top of that, you can meet [Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto](/#speakers), [Koichi Sasada](/#speakers) and [Steve Klabnik](/#speakers) who have already confirmed they are going to speak at this year’s EuRuKo. One last thing: you know that you cannot come to Athens and not have a party! That’s all been taken care of by our [sponsors](/#sponsors) :-)

Can't wait to see you in Athens! Until then, you can [watch the countdown](/#tickets) :)

**UPDATE:** We decided to sell 150 tickets due to high demand.
