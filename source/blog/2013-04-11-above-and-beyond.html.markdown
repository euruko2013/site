The first ticket batch is less than a day away, the anticipation rises and even though this year I don't actually have to worry about getting a ticket I still feel excited.

Community participation has so far been very strong with a lot of very interesting topics covered in our [CfP](http://cfp.euruko2013.org).  We are right on track for one more awesome Euruko!

We have been committed from the beginning to keeping the ticket cost as low as possible and this would certainly have not been possible without our brilliant [sponsors](http://euruko2013.org/#sponsors) 
We also hear from individuals from the community that they would like to contribute as well so we will continue the tradition of offering a limited number of tickets for a higher price.

So this year we will offer up to 20 Supporter tickets for 250€ each . We know you will not do it to get your name on the "honor roll" but we would be ungrateful if we didn't do just that. We'll even add your fancy company title!

The tickets will go on sale together with the first ticket batch and we will add the Supporter names to the Euruko2013 website as soon as possible
