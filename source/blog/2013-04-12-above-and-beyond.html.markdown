The first ticket batch is [only some hours away](/#tickets), the anticipation rises and even though this year I don't actually have to worry about getting a ticket I still feel excited.

Community participation has so far been very strong with a lot of very interesting topics covered in our [CfP](http://cfp.euruko2013.org).  We are right on track for one more awesome EuRuKo!

We committed from the beginning to keep the ticket cost as low as possible and this would certainly have not been possible without our brilliant [sponsors](/#sponsors).
We also hear from individuals in the community that they would like to contribute as well so we will continue the tradition of offering a limited number of tickets for a higher price.

So this year we will offer up to 20 Supporter tickets for **250 â‚¬** each for those of you who want to go above and beyond. We know you will not do it to get your name on the "honor roll" but we would be ungrateful if we didn't do just that. We'll even add your fancy company name, along your name, if you want!

The tickets will go on sale together with the [first ticket batch](/blog/2013-04-08-announcing-the-1st-batch-of-tickets/) and we will add the Supporters' names to the [EuRuKo 2013](/#contributors) website as soon as possible.
