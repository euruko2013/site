There are *less than 10 days left* before the end of [the presentations' submission period](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/about#dates)
and we thought it would be nice to share some numbers and some feedback of the process so far.

**Spoiler:** *it's going great and we're not even halfway there!*

**Here are some rough, rounded numbers about the process:**

* [52 proposals](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals) *(3 withdrawn)*
* Close to [200 users](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/motivation)
* 150 suggestions
* 600 votes
* 10000 impressions

**Here are some comments regarding the process:**

> Intrigued and impressed by @euruko's open and social CFP process ([@pat_shaughnessy](https://twitter.com/pat_shaughnessy/status/317244488877752320))

> I really liked the anonymous approach Euruko was going for ([Bamboo](http://cfp.euruko2013.org/proposals/14#suggestion_20))

> EuRuKo CfP! This time 10 talks are choosen by the community. Hosting conferences was never easier :-P ([@bovensiepen](https://twitter.com/bovensiepen/status/317293688948658176)) *(\*)*

*(\*)* No, **it's not**!!! See the section below... :P

**And here are some number for the application itself:**

* [500+ commits](https://github.com/euruko2013/vestibule/commits/euruko2013)
* [12 contributors](https://github.com/euruko2013/vestibule/graphs/contributors)
* [19 forks](https://github.com/rubymanor/vestibule/network) of the original [_Vestibule_ app](https://github.com/rubymanor/vestibule)
* At least 5 *"fremium"* services used to make it be live _(more on this on another blog post)_
