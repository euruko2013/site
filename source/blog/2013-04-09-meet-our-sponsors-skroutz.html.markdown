[Skroutz](http://www.skroutz.gr/company/en?from=euruko_blog) being a Gaia sponsor of EuRuKo was pleasantly inevitable!
The Skroutz team has assisted in the preliminary preparations and support and has been waiting for
EuRuKo so badly, that we just couldn’t stop them from being our top sponsor. Furthermore,
their willingness to become EuRuKo 2013 Gaia sponsor is justified by the fact that there is a
thriving Ruby community within the Skroutz team.

Skroutz.gr began as a hobby project in order to help three ordinary guys find, organize
and compare prices for their favorite gadgets. This tech-eCommerce startup came to life
in 2005 from a small-scale team of three people. Today, Skroutz.gr is a leading ecommerce
brand in Greece consisting of passionate individuals; a diverse range of people with a
spectrum of skills and capabilities which tackle the challenges of creating and
creatively extending expectations. A team of 40+ top-class professionals make up the working
force behind the best price comparison engine in Greece and the number is always growing :)

The “force” between Skroutz.gr and Ruby is strong. Skroutz.gr is built on RoR and takes
full advantage of all the magical features which the Ruby programming language offers. As already
mentioned, several members of the Greek Ruby community “live” and enhance
their experience within Skroutz by undertaking and creating really amazing projects.

Apart from Skroutz.gr many ambitious projects were built during the course of the last 8
years, including [Skroutzstore](http://www.skroutzstore.gr/home) (a user-friendly platform for the creation of a fully operational
e-shop in just 10 minutes), [Skroutz MyBill](http://mybill.skroutz.gr/) (a spin off which extends comparison portfolio
to telecommunication services), [Soby](http://www.soby.gr/) (the first deal aggregator in Greece) and recently
[Alve.com](http://www.alve.com/) (a price comparison engine adjusted to the needs of the Turkish market).
