##Creating an avatar image

 * Open the picture you want to use as an avatar and resize it to 106px height.
 * Paste the resized image as a separate layer in avatars.psd
 * Show the frame layer over the layer you just created 
 * Select the frame layer and use the magic wand to select the borders of the frame
 * Select the new avatar layer and erase everything the magic wand selected
 * Hide the frame layer and save as .png

 Since I did this in [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) I cannot guarantee it will work the same in Photoshop.
